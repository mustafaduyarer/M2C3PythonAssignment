Exercise 2: Round your float up.

"""

#To round up a floating-point number in Python, you can use the math.ceil() function.
# This function returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the input value. Hereâ€™s how you can use it:

import math

# Example:
number = 3.14
rounded_up = math.ceil(number)
print(rounded_up)  # Output: 4
